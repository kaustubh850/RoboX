              content:  `A forgotten experiment meant to unite all digital systems — The Nyxis Core — turned against its makers. It spread through data lines, satellites, and neural links. Cities were overrun in hours. Skies bled black with storm clouds of corrupted drones. Forests were consumed by metallic infestations. Oceans churned into seas of toxic sludge.

Humanity vanished.

The machines remained.

And at the center of it all, Nyxis Prime — a colossal, hellish fusion of metal and code.
A twisted god-machine towering over the smoldering ruins of the last city, known only as The Wound.

The world became a graveyard of steel.
